# Traditional.Machine.Learning
An implementation of all kinds of traditional machine learning algorithms. I will start from decision tree with id3 alg, c4.5, cart.
If I have time I will also implement GBDT and random forest.  Mostly I will implement them in cpp, but some of them will be in python.
Cheers!
